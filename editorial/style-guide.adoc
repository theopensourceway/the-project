|*For time*, use numerals, a space, lowercase letters, and periods for a.m. and p.m.

* *Do not use extra zeros* on times.

* *Specify time zone* (include “D” if daylight savings is in effect).

* *Include UTC time* for global audiences.

|*Spell out numbers under 10.*

*Use numerals for 10 and above*, unless it’s the first word of the sentence.
|There are five directors. No, wait, there are 15. Sixteen, now that I count them.
|===

== Punctuation
|===
|Rule |Example

|Always use the *Oxford (serial) comma.*
|Apples, oranges, and bananas.

|*Avoid exclamation points.*
|No more than one per document.

Zero, if possible.

|Avoid ampersands (*&*) or plus signs (*+*).
|Use _only_ if truly necessary to omit 2 extra characters, in which case, use plus sign.
|===

== Headlines and titles
|===
|Rule |Example

|*Use sentence case capitalization* for headlines, headings, subheadings, job titles, and most other situations. (Capitalize only first word, proper nouns, and first word after a colon or em-dash.)

*Exceptions*: Use “title case” for product, event, and award titles.

== That vs. which, plus tricky comma questions
|===
|Essential = no comma |Nonessential = comma

|I will give the document to my peer Chris.

_(I have more than one peer. Chris’s name is essential info and should not be set off with a comma.)_

|I will give the document to my director, Kim.

_(I have only one director. Her name is nonessential and thus set off with a comma.)_

|*That* |*Which*

|John’s cars *that* are leased are never kept clean.

_(The dirty cars are specifically those that John leased; John might have non-leased cars that are kept clean.)_

|John’s cars, *which* are leased, are never kept clean.

_(All of John’s cars are dirty. The fact that those cars are leased is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.)_


|We visited Berlin too.

_(“Too” is an adverb. When a sentence ends with an adverb that is essential to the meaning of the sentence, the adverb should not be set off with a comma.)_

|Mary Smith, a staff writer at the Big City Times, recently wrote a book on that subject.

_(Nonessential information requires a comma.)_
