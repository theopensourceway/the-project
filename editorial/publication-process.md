# The Open Source Way Publishing Process 

The Open Source Way's project workflow is largely dependent on the functionality of the GitHub platform.
GitHub is a web-based, distributed version control tool that enables content creators to build and collaborate on text-based creations (code, prose) wherever they can connect to the internet.
Before beginning work on The Open Source Way, contributors must have a GitHub account.
All work done on The Open Source Way will be done within the [guidebook repository](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook) of the [The Open Source Way organization](https://github.com/theopensourceway).
This work will be under the [project's license](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
