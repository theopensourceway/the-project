## That vs. which, plus tricky comma questions

| Essential = no comma | Nonessential = comma | 
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| I will give the document to my peer Chris.<br><br>*(I have more than one peer. Chris’s name is essential info and should not be set off with a comma.)* | I will give the document to my director, Kim.<br><br>*(I have only one director. Her name is nonessential and thus set off with a comma.)* |
| We visited Berlin too.<br><br>*("Too" is an adverb. When a sentence ends with an adverb that is essential to the meaning of the sentence, the adverb should not be set off with a comma.)* | Mary Smith, a staff writer at the Big City Times, recently wrote a book on that subject.<br><br>*(Nonessential information requires a comma.)* |

| That | Which |
| ---- | ----- |
| John's cars **that** are leased are never kept clean.<br><br>*(The dirty cars are specifically those that John leased; John might have non-leased cars that are kept clean.)* | John’s cars, **which** are leased, are never kept clean.<br><br>*(All of John’s cars are dirty. The fact that those cars are leased is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.)* |
