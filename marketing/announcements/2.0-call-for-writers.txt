Fellow Open Source Practitioners,

We are pleased to announce:

The Open Source Way 2.0 is ready for you and your pen and your paperâ€”let the writing begin!

The initial sections and chapters have been finalized in a process that included a Birds of Feather session at FOSDEM 2020 in Brussels and a workshop at SCaLE 18x in Pasadena.
